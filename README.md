# Mapping Inequality in SARS-CoV-2 Household Exposure and Transmission Risk in the USA

### Summary of Study and Results
Evidence on SARS-CoV-2 transmission suggests low-income, essential workers face higher rates of exposure and may be unable to isolate due to lack of space in their homes and risks of income and job loss. Using the American Community Survey, this study examines “high-risk households”, defined as having at least one essential worker and fewer rooms than household members.

An estimated 17.7 million people live in high-risk households. 58% have income below 200% of the Federal Poverty Level and 31% live in multigenerational households. People of color (39% of the total population) account for 76% of those in high-risk households. Compared to non-Hispanic White people, a greater proportion of people of color live in high-risk households in 96% of the 2,351 geographic areas analyzed (average 5.5 times higher).

This study maps an important dimension of structural inequality that is closely linked to COVID-19 risks and health disparities and that can be used in prioritizing prevention efforts.
